# Proxy Server with HTTPS Support

This proxy server forwards requests to the Backpack Exchange API with HTTPS support.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Generate SSL certificates (for development):
```bash
npm run generate-ssl
```

This creates self-signed certificates in the `ssl/` directory.

## Running the Server

### Development (HTTP + HTTPS)
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production (HTTPS only)
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

## Ports

- **HTTP**: 3000 (default)
- **HTTPS**: 3443 (default)

You can customize ports using environment variables:
- `PORT`: HTTP port
- `HTTPS_PORT`: HTTPS port

## SSL Certificates

### Development
The server uses self-signed certificates generated by `npm run generate-ssl`.

### Production
For production, replace the certificates in the `ssl/` directory with proper SSL certificates from a certificate authority:

1. Place your certificate as `ssl/cert.pem`
2. Place your private key as `ssl/key.pem`

## Usage

Once running, the proxy server will be available at:
- HTTP: `http://localhost:3000`
- HTTPS: `https://localhost:3443`

All requests are forwarded to `https://api.backpack.exchange`.

## CORS

The server is configured to allow requests from `http://localhost:1420` (Tauri app).

## Health Check

Check if the server is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# or
curl https://localhost:3443/health
```
